# currencyapp

.env file I have used for security purposes. API URL is available for that file. I have already shared this with Ignacio Elorduy.

Instructions
1. flutter SDK latest version 3.3.3
2. Create project using com.currency.app.
3. Using Getx or bLoc. But here I have used Getx.
4. Flutter run - check in debug mode
5. flutter build apk --release use this cmd build tha apk

Design pattern

1. GetX is not only a state management library but it is an ultra light, fast, reliable microframework for flutter which provides route management and dependency injection as well. Flutter is moving very fast and gaining a favorite place amongst developers.

2.MVC pattern
3.Get_cli with help automatically created view,controller,provider and models
4.Easily codes maintain.

Image loaded
1.cached_network_image 3.2.2 (A flutter library to show images from the internet and keep them in the cache directory).

Database
1.Sqflite - Large data loaded.
2.Get storage - Gext pattern using. so I have used get storage.
3.Shared preference.
